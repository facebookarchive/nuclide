/**
 * Opens the given file.
 *
 * Optionally include a line and column to navigate to. If a line is given, by default it will
 * center it in the opened text editor.
 *
 * This should be preferred over `atom.workspace.open()` in typical cases. The motivations are:
 * - We call `atom.workspace.open()` with the `searchAllPanes` option. This looks in other panes for
 *   the current file, rather just opening a new copy in the current pane. People often forget this
 *   option which typically leads to a subpar experience for people who use multiple panes.
 * - When moving around in the current file, `goToLocation` explicitly publishes events that the nav
 *   stack uses.
 *
 * Currently, `atom.workspace.open()` should be used only in these cases:
 * - When the URI to open is not a file URI. For example, if we want to open some tool like find
 *   references in a pane.
 * - When we want to open an untitled file (providing no file argument). Currently, goToLocation
 *   requires a file to open.
 * - When we want to open a file as a pending pane item. Currently goToLocation cannot do this.
 *
 * In these cases, you may disable the lint rule against `atom.workspace.open` by adding the
 * following comment above its use:
 * // eslint-disable-next-line nuclide-internal/atom-apis
